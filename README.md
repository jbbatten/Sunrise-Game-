Sunrise is an atmospheric roguelike game, developed for my 3rd year University 'Expressive Game Design' module.

Built in Godot engine with GDscript.

### Description ###
Survive for 10 minutes if you want to see the sunrise! Make sure your solar bar doesn't deplete or you will die. Collect 'Solar Crystals' around the map to keep yourself alive. The compass indicator at the top points the way. Pick between 2 traits and 1 item per level. Choose wisely! It is recommended to take items first to build up your characters power, and traits to finish off a specific build. You can equip items by dragging them from your inventory into an empty equipment slot. Multiples of the same items equipped enhances the potency of the weapon.

Good luck! and see you at dawn!
